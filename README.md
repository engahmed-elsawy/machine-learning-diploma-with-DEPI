# Machine Learning Diploma with DEPI

This repository contains my hands-on projects and exercises from the **Machine Learning Diploma with DEPI**. It covers the full ML pipeline—from data preprocessing and modeling to deep learning, NLP, computer vision, and cloud deployment with Azure & MLFlow.

## What’s Inside
- **Mathematics for ML:** Linear algebra, probability, and optimization concepts applied in code.
- **Python Programming:** Clean, modular, and efficient ML code.
- **Data Preprocessing & Visualization:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, and insightful visualizations.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Supervised & unsupervised algorithms, evaluation, and tuning.
- **Deep Learning:** Neural networks, training pipelines, and performance improvements.
- **NLP & Computer Vision:** Text and image processing, embeddings, and model building.
- **Cloud & Experiment Management:** Azure deployment and MLFlow tracking.

This repository is continuously updated to showcase practical, end-to-end machine learning solutions.
